# COVID
Brings together international COVID19 data, created by John Hopkins University and uploaded onto Kaggle. An interactive world map, with a date slider is outputted. Hovering over a country will show: death rate, number of confirmed cases, number of deaths, number recovered and what the school closure policy was at the time.

This Python notebook can be used to merge the data and create an interactive world map with a date slider to show the progression of COVID internationally.
